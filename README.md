## Ohio State Hackathon 2016

### Daniel Miller, Nabil Wadih, Blake Howard, Stephen Robb, and Kyla Bouldin

### Description:
This rails app was created at the 2016 Ohio State hackaton. The main goal of the app is to create a plan for a bar crawl by an individual or group of friends. At the moment, we have implemented bar finders, bar path creaters, and a budget to spend for the night with amount spent at each bar. We plan to add more as time allows


### Plans for the Future:
1. Mobile App
  * Check out RubyMotion
2. Expansion of current app
  * Friends list
  * Sorting bars
  * Location tracking
